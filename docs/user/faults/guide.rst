Machine Fault Log
=================

In order to help you keep track of any machine issues, QATrack+ allows you to
record machine faults using the fault log introduced in version 3.1.0. Faults
can either be logged directly on the page when performing QC work, or using the
standalone page for entering faults.


.. _fault_log_new_fault:

Entering a new fault
--------------------

.. note::

    Only units with the "Is Serviceable" flag set will be shown in the Unit's
    drop down.

In order to enter a new machine fault, select the **Enter a new fault** option
from the **Fault Log** menu at the top of the page.

   Entering a new fault

* **Date & Time fault occurred** Enter approximately when the fault took place
* **Unit, Modality*** When you select the Unit the fault occurred on, the
  **Treatment or Imaging Modality** drop downs will be populated with any
  treatment or imaging modality options :ref:`configured for your unit
  <units_admin>`.  The **Modality** field is optional.
* **Fault Type** After typing the first two characters of the **Fault type**,
  the drop down will be populated with any matching Fault Type codes already in
  the Fault type database.  If the fault code does not already exist in the
  database, you should enter (and select) the full fault code.  This
  :ref:`Fault Type <fault_type>` will be added to the database when you submit
  your fault.
* **Related Service Events** In this field you may optionally select one or
  more related service events by entering their service event IDs.

* **Comment** Add any comments you think might be useful for anyone reviewing
  the fault.

* **Reviewers** If your administrator has configured :ref:`Fault Review Groups
  <fault_review_groups>` you will be able to select the users who were notified
  of this fault.

Click **Log Fault** once you've finished entering the data.

.. _fault_log_new_fault_qc:

Entering a new fault while performing QC
----------------------------------------

In addition to the above method of logging a new fault, you can log a new fault
directly on the page when performing QC.  In order to do this click the **Log
Fault** item from the left sidebar.

Complete the other details then click **Log Fault**.  The dialogue will
automatically close after the fault is logged successfully.


Reviewing Faults
----------------

.. note::

    In order to review faults after they are logged, the user will need to 
    belong to a group with the `Can review faults` permission.

If your administrator has *not* configured :ref:`Fault Review Groups
<fault_review_groups>` then after submitting a fault, it will be in an
unreviewed state.  In order to mark faults as reviewed select the
**Unreviewed** menu item from the **Faults** menu.

On the next page you can click the  **Review** button (if you don't have fault
review permissions this button will say **Details**) for the fault you want to
review.

same type of fault at the bottom of the page.

Fault Notifications
-------------------

There are two types of notifications you can set up for faults:

#. :ref:`notifications-fault-logged`: to notifiy people when a fault is first
   logged.
#. :ref:`notifications-fault-review`: to periodically notify people when there
   are unreviewed faults.
