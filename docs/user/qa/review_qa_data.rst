Changing QA Data Statuses
=========================

Every test that is performed in QATrack+ is assigned a
`Status <../admin/statuses.md>`__ that indicates what type of data the
test is and whether or not it requires review. Details on how to review
QA data and/or update the status of a set of tests are given below.

Reviewing QA Data
-----------------

The number of test lists with unreviewed tests is displayed at the top
of every QATrack+ page (provided you have the permissions required to
review data).

To review data, choose the **Unreviewed** option from the **Review
Data** dropdown menu at the top of the page.

You will then be presented with a list of QA sessions awaiting review.
This list can be filtered/sorted by unit, frequency, date or user.

Click on the **Review** button of the QA session that you want to review
and you can then change the status of the tests as described below.

statuses can also be set individually.) Click the **Update Test
