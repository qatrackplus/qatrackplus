Welcome to QATrack+'s documentation!
====================================


About QATrack+ v3.1.1
---------------------

QATrack+ is a fully configurable, free, and open source (MIT License) web
application for managing QC data for radiation therapy and medical imaging
equipment. QATrack+ is used in `many hospitals and clinics around the world
<http://qatrackplus.com/#whos-using>`_!

QATrack+ is a replacement for error prone spreadsheets and other in-house
databases. It brings structure and organization to your QA program while
retaining much of the flexibility of spreadsheets.  Built in scheduling,
reports, notifications, and charts make keeping on top of your machine QA
program a breeze!

The main features include:

* :ref:`Record <qa_perform>` & :ref:`review <qa_review>` your QC data via a
  user friendly web application.

* Fully customized QC tests.  You configure QATrack+ to record the data that is
  important to you.  QATrack+ comes with a number of :ref:`test types
  <qa_tests>` including:

    * numerical
    * text
    * file upload & analysis using Python scripts (arbitrary file types including DICOM, JPG, TIFF etc)
    * yes/no
    * multiple choice
    * calculations using Python snippets
    * date & times
    * and :ref:`more <qa_tests>`!

* Schedule your QC on a daily, weekly, monthly, semi-annual, annual or define
  your own custom scheduling recurrence rules.

* Configure :ref:`notifications <notifications>` to alert you when:

    * Scheduled QC tests are due or overdue
    * QC tests are completed
    * Service events are created
    * :ref:`more <notifications>`!

* Built in :ref:`data charts <qa_charts>` for trending numerical test results.
  Data can be filtered by unit, date, or frequency, and can also be exported
  for external analysis.

* :ref:`PDF & Excel reports <reports>` that can be generated on the fly, or
  delivered to you via email on a schedule of your choosing.

* Support for :ref:`multiple user groups <qa_auth>` (e.g. Administrators,
  Physicists, Assistants, Therapists, etc) with user & group-specific
  privileges and test lists, as well as a configurable user authentication
  system.

* Easily integrate test procedures into data entry forms via embedded html
  or links to external documentation.

* Save incomplete work and complete it a later date.

* Perform manual :ref:`review & approval <qa_review>` of QC data or use
  :ref:`Auto Review Rules <qa_auto_review>` to cut down your QC Review
  workload.

* Integrated :ref:`Service Log <service_log>` for tracking service events and
  machine downtime

* Parts tracker for tracking spare parts on hand, part costs and vendors

* The flexibility to host on an intranet or www, requiring minimal resources
  from IT departments. Can optionally be managed within a physics department if
  permitted by local institution policies.
