Test Categories
===============

It can be useful to separate tests into different categories. For
example, if you have a test list for morning QA on a machine that
consists of both dosimetry and safety tests, and occasionally wish to
perform only the dosimetry tests, having the tests in separate
categories allows you to easily perform a `subset of the tests from a
test list <../users/performing_a_test_list>`__.

New categories are straightforward to define: from the main admin page,
click on the **Categories** link, then click **Add category**, fill out
the fields and **Save**.
